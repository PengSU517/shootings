Sparse regression for large data sets with outliers

- This package provides the functions to compute the sparse shooting S proposed by Bottmer et.al (2021). All those functions were forked from https://github.com/ineswilms/sparse-shooting-S. I constructed a package of those functions to make them more convenient to use.
